# :page_with_curl: Cisco-IOS-Command-CheatSheets


The CCNA (v6 and v7) courses at Cisco Networking Academy cover all the key topics for the CCNA certification exam. Alongside most of them, Cisco IOS commands for network devices such as routers and switches are presented.

:star2: This project aims to gather all the courses' switch and router commands in a space where everyone (not just _Netacad_ learners) can quickly and easily refer to such commands. :star2:

Aiming to be useful, easy to read, and provide as many valuable information to learners and professionals as possible:  

Commands are organized by topic,
>:trophy: best practices are presented,

## Motivation

While the initial aim of this repository was
- To gather all the commands found throughout the CCNA2 v6 course in one place
- To help myself to master the commands, and learn more deeply about them and Cisco IOS in order to provide up-to-date and clear information in this space

I'm now convinced the project can grow further with constant work and research, and expand its scope to all the IOS commands relevant to the CCNA exam.
